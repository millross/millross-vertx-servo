# millross-vertx-servo

Simple project to play around with servo for metrics gathering. Primarily for learning servo rather than anything else.

Consists of a simple webserver with a specific endpoint which will update a custom metric value to be sent to servo. The
aim is then to write out via servo to a dashboard to be configured separately.

I used graphite as the dashboarding technology for testing (hence the graphite-servo dependency) via the docker file
here https://github.com/nickstenning/docker-graphite

Note that if using docker on OS X, when your Mac sleeps, the time as observed by your container will drift, possibly
causing data to appear to go missing. The only mechanism I have identified to resolve this is to restart docker
(restarting the container is not sufficient). So if you're not seeing data when you expect to, the first move should be
to run bash inside your container, and dheck the system time.
