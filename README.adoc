# millross-vertx-servo

Simple project to play around with servo for metrics gathering. Primarily for learning servo rather than anything else.

Consists of a simple webserver with a specific endpoint which will update a custom metric value to be sent to servo. The aim is then to write out via servo to a dashboard to be configured separately.
